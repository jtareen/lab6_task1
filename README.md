# Responsive Grid Layout in Flutter

This Flutter project demonstrates how to create a responsive grid layout using the `GridView` widget. The grid dynamically adjusts the number of columns based on the screen width, making it adaptable to various screen sizes.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The number of columns is calculated dynamically based on the screen width.
- **Image Display**: Loads images from a list of local assets.
- **Customizable Layout**: Spacing, column width, and other properties are easy to configure.
- **AppBar with Shadow**: The AppBar includes an elevation effect to create a shadow below it for a polished UI.

## Requirements
- Flutter SDK installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository or copy the source code.
2. Replace the `imageUrls` list in the `ResponsiveGridScreen` widget with your image URLs or local asset paths.
3. Run the app using the following command:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```  

## Code Explanation

### Responsive Grid
The number of columns in the grid is calculated dynamically using the `LayoutBuilder` widget:
```dart
int columns = (constraints.maxWidth / 150).floor();
```
This divides the screen width by a fixed column width (150 pixels) to determine how many columns fit the screen.

### AppBar Shadow
The `elevation` property of the `AppBar` widget is set to add a shadow below it:
```dart
elevation: 5.0,
shadowColor: Colors.black,
```

## Customization
- **Column Width**: Adjust the value used to calculate columns (`constraints.maxWidth / 150`) for wider or narrower items.
- **Spacing**: Modify `crossAxisSpacing` and `mainAxisSpacing` in the `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount` for custom spacing between items.
- **Shadow**: Change `elevation` or `shadowColor` in the `AppBar` to tweak its appearance.
